# CLIBattleships

As the project name implies, this is a Battleships game played on console. It's written in C#. There are two variations:
1) Classic: Your regular game of Battleships.
2) Salvo Variation: A little more complicated, it would take longer to explain it here than just googling it up.

This project is naught but a fun little time-killer. Feel free to use it for entertainment (I'd be shocked if you could use it commercially, honestly).
Have fun, report any bugs if you do find one.
Thank you.

Note: Before running, change the path string to your own absolute path of the "GameSettings.txt" file in the FileHandler class.
